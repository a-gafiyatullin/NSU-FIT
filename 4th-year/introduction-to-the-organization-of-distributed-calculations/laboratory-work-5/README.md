## <strong>Build</strong>:
From the root of the project:<br>
<code>cmake .<br>make</code><br>
File <code>laboratory-work-5</code> will be generated.

## <strong>Run</strong>:
<code>./laboratory-work-5 [dht-port] [io-port] [bootstrap-node-info-file]</code><br>
<code>dht-port</code> - port for the interaction between nodes<br>
<code>io-port</code>  - port for the download requests from this node<br>
<code>bootstrap-node-info-file</code>  - file with the information about another node that is in the net:<br>
File format by lines:<br>
1st - hash of the known node (20 values between 0 and 255)<br>
2nd - IPv4 address of the known node<br>
3rd - dht port of the known node<br>
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
<code>57 129 115 203 226 165 20 59 251 70 58 235 246 157 68 112 223 227 219 160<br>
